;; Little reminder from your friendly neighborhood 2110 TA staff:
;; don't run this directly by pressing 'RUN' in complx, since there is nothing
;; put at address x3000. Instead, load it and use 'Debug' -> 'Simulate Subroutine
;; Call' and choose the 'decimalStringToInt' label.

.orig x3000

halt

checkTreeEquality
;; Put the code for the CHECKTREEEQUALITY subroutine here





; Needed by Simulate Subroutine Call in complx
STACK .fill xF000
.end
